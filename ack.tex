I want to express my gratitude towards Emil Ivov, who, in the last two years,
has provided me with a tremendous amount of help and support. As my teacher he has been an
inspiration. As my boss he has allowed me to work on many interesting problems,
patiently listened to my usually not very well expressed ideas, and often
trusted me more than I trust myself. As my supervisor during the internship and
the writing of this report, he has provided invaluable advice, always specific and spot-on.
As none-of-the-above he has always been especially understanding and encouraging. Thank you, Emil!

I am also grateful to my family for their continued love and support.
